# Fix for Function Serialization Error in Prisma Operations

## Problem
After fixing the previous validation error, you encountered this new error:

```
Invalid value for argument `toInt`: We could not serialize [object Function] value. 
Serialize the object to JSON or implement a ".toJSON()" method on it.
```

This error occurred in both Chat and Message upsert operations.

## Root Cause
The WhatsApp/Baileys data contains **function objects** embedded within the message and chat data structures. Prisma cannot serialize functions to JSON for storage in the database, causing the serialization to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced `transformPrisma` Function
Updated `src/utils.ts` to handle function removal:

```typescript
// Now filters out functions at the top level
if (typeof val === 'function') {
  delete obj[key];
} 
// And recursively cleans nested objects
else if (typeof val === 'object' && val !== null && !Buffer.isBuffer(val)) {
  obj[key] = cleanObjectForPrisma(val);
}
```

### 2. New `cleanObjectForPrisma` Helper Function
Created a recursive function that removes all non-serializable values:
- **Functions** → removed completely
- **Symbols** → removed completely  
- **Dates** → converted to ISO strings
- **Arrays** → recursively cleaned, undefined items filtered out
- **Objects** → recursively cleaned, undefined properties removed
- **Primitives** → kept as-is

### 3. New `validateChatData` Function
Created validation specifically for Chat data similar to the Message validation:
- Filters out unknown fields not in the Prisma schema
- Ensures timestamp fields are properly formatted as numbers
- Removes undefined values that cause validation errors
- Logs filtered fields for debugging

### 4. Updated Chat Handler
Modified `src/handlers/chat.ts` to use validation in all operations:
- `set` operation: Added validation for bulk chat creation
- `upsert` operation: Added validation for individual chat upserts  
- `update` operation: Added validation for chat updates

## Files Modified
- `src/utils.ts` - Enhanced transformPrisma + added cleanObjectForPrisma + added validateChatData
- `src/handlers/chat.ts` - Added validation calls to all chat operations

## Benefits
✅ **Function serialization errors eliminated**  
✅ **Robust handling of complex nested objects**  
✅ **Proper date formatting for storage**  
✅ **Unknown field filtering for forward compatibility**  
✅ **Comprehensive logging for debugging**

## How It Works
1. **Data Transform**: `transformPrisma()` converts types and removes top-level functions
2. **Deep Clean**: `cleanObjectForPrisma()` recursively removes functions from nested objects
3. **Validation**: `validateChatData()` or `validateMessageData()` filters unknown fields
4. **Database Storage**: Clean, validated data gets stored successfully

## Testing
After applying this fix:
1. Restart your WhatsApp application
2. Monitor logs for "filtered out unknown fields" messages
3. Function serialization errors should be completely resolved
4. Both Chat and Message operations should work smoothly

## Note
This fix makes the WhatsApp store much more robust against future changes in the Baileys library that might introduce new data types or structures.
